                        The practically indestructible 10-metre long steel structure is being built on a granite plane on the west coast of Tasmania, Australia. The final location is currently unknown, with its creators saying it has been chosen for its “geopolitical and geological stability.” <br>
                        
                        Construction is due to start next year but many of the details of the project are shrouded in mystery. <br>
                        
                        The black box will be powered by solar panels to ensure it keeps running even if external sources fail. Inside will be computers and hard drives recording an “unbiased account of the events that led to the demise of the planet.”</p>

                    Cook Islands: Still COVID-free after positive test is found to be a false alarm

                        By Maeve Campbell  •  Updated: 07/12/2021
                        The Cook Islands has been recognised as the top destination to visit in 2022 - and the good news is - it's still COVID-free. <br>
                        
                        In early December, officials panicked when they thought they had recorded the first case of the virus. A 10-year-old boy who had travelled from Auckland to Rarotonga, the main island, was found to test positive twice. <br>
                        
                        However, the tests were considered "weak positives" and he tested negative soon after, leading officials to believe that it was merely a historical case. This could mean the young boy was exposed to the virus in the past but did not have it and was not infectious. <br>
                        
                        "Today’s ‘negative’ result [...] means we did not detect any virus in the mucus sample we took from the boy. This is good news," said the country's secretary of health, Bob Williams.</p>

                    Solomon Islands leader survives no confidence vote after riots
                </h1><br>
                <div class="col-12 text-center">

                    <p class="text-light" style="margin-left: 3vh;margin-left: 3vh;">Lawmakers in the Solomon Islands debated on Monday whether they still have confidence in the prime minister, after rioters last month set fire to buildings and looted stores in the capital. <br>

                        Many businesses remained closed in Honiara ahead of the vote over concerns that violence could erupt again, leading to an eerie calm. <br>
                        
                        Troops and police from Australia, Papua New Guinea, Fiji and New Zealand are helping keep the peace at the request of the Solomon Islands government. <br>
                        
                        The riots grew from a peaceful protest that highlighted long-simmering regional rivalries, economic problems and concerns about the country’s increasing links with China.</p>
