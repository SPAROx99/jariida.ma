                    <p class="text-light" style="margin-left: 3vh;margin-left: 3vh;">Fueled by this, as well as societal expectations, the number of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) regulations and standards globally have nearly doubled in the last five years. An Increasing number of businesses are voluntarily committing to being more transparent about their nonfinancial value. Standards are converging and streamlining to create a common language. The IFRS Foundation is endeavouring this with the launch of its initiative in November 2021 to build on existing major frameworks and create a minimum global framework for sustainability-related financial reporting standards that are aligned with enterprise value. </p>

                    <p class="text-light" style="margin-left: 3vh;margin-left: 3vh;">The EU Sustainable Finance Action Plan launched in 2019 sets out a series of regulations with the aim to increase transparency over the capital flows towards the real economy thus directing investments towards sustainable activities. Mandatory ESG disclosures for financial market players through the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) which came into force in March 2021 are augmenting the need for information. While the Taxonomy Regulation, applicable from 2022, mandates the use of a common language on sustainable activities for both financial and non-financial entities, the Corporate Social Responsibility Directive (CSRD) proposed in April 2021 significantly extends the content scope and coverage of current non-financial reporting requirements.</p>

                        Bilateral US-Russia talks will start in Geneva on 9 January, followed by a Russia-NATO Council meeting in Brussels two days later and negotiations in Vienna within the OSCE framework on 13 January, Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters early on Friday Moscow time. The two leaders agreed to keep in regular contact during the negotiations and to oversee the bilateral talks directly, he said.</p>

                        Justice Minister Sam Tanson is planning to file a legal complaint against a prominent anti-vaxxer over a Tweet in which he compared Luxembourg's push for Covid-19 vaccines to Nazi medical experiments and appeared to endorse hanging as a punishment for politicians. <br><br>
                        
                        Journalist Jean-Marie Jacoby took to Twitter to say that "death by hanging would have been the sanction of the American military judges at Nuremberg in 1947 for Bettel and Tanson if they really want to force people to participate in a 3rd phase clinical medical trial. . . ups".</p>
