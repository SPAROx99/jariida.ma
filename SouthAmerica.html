                    Hugo Maradona: Diego Maradona's younger brother dies aged 52
                </h1><br>

                    <p class="text-light" style="margin-left: 3vh;margin-left: 3vh;">Hugo Maradona, the brother of Argentine legend Diego Maradona, has died of a heart attack at the age of 52. <br><br>

                        Hugo, who was also a professional footballer, died at his home near Naples, the city in which Diego played at his peak from 1984 to 1991. <br><br>
                        
                        It comes 13 months after older sibling Diego, widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, died from cardiac arrest at the age of 60. <br><br>
                        
                        In a nomadic career, Hugo played in Italy, Spain, Japan and Argentina. <br><br>
                        
                        Hugo Maradona joined Diego at Napoli in 1987 but failed to make an impact and went on to represent clubs including Ascoli and Rayo Vallecano. <br><br>
                        
                        "The thoughts of club president Aurelio De Laurentiis, vice president Edoardo De Laurentiis, officials, coaching staff, the players and the whole SSC Napoli family are with the Maradona family after the sad passing of Hugo," said Napoli in a statement.</p>

                    Biodiversity: The tale of the 'un-extinct' fish

                        The species that the Chester Zoo conservationist is talking about - the Tequila fish - has now been returned to the wild after being declared extinct.
                        
                        "Missing" since 2003, it is back in the rivers of south-west Mexico. <br><br>
                        
                        The reintroduction is being held up as an example of how freshwater ecosystems and species can be saved.</p>

                    The drama of Peru's Covid orphans

                    <p class="text-light" style="margin-left: 3vh;margin-left: 3vh;">In a tiny house on the outskirts of Lima, Gabriela Zarate lives with her husband and eight children. Four are her own. The other four, two girls aged seven and 15, and two boys aged nine and 12, are the children of her younger sister, Katherine.  <br><br>

                        It is hard to squeeze them all in. The boys sleep two to a bunk bed, with the girls sharing a tiny room at the back of the house. "It's always been a struggle to put food on the table for my family," Gabriela says, "and with four more children it's even more difficult". <br><br>
                        
                        In June 2020, when Peru was already struggling to contain Covid-19, Katherine got infected. Hospitals were overcrowded, supplies had run out and relatives watched their loved ones die, unable to help.</p>

                    Covid: Ecuador makes vaccination mandatory for most citizens
                </h1><br>
                <div class="col-12 text-center">
                    <img style="margin-left: 3vh;" width="500" src="st4.jpg" alt=""><br><br>
                    <p class="text-light" style="margin-left: 3vh;margin-left: 3vh;">Ecuador has announced that the Covid-19 vaccine will be mandatory for most citizens, saying the measure is needed because of a rise in infections and the spread of variants such as Omicron. <br><br>

                        The health ministry said there were enough doses to "immunise the entire population". Those with a medical justification will be exempt. <br><br>
                        
                        All others aged five or over must be vaccinated. 
                        
                        To date, 77.2% of the eligible population has been given two doses. 
                        
                        And more than 900,000 people have received a booster shot. 
                        
                        The ministry said vaccines were a "shield of protection" against the virus, helping to prevent serious illness, hospitalisations and deaths. 
                        
                        The decision, it added, was based in the country's constitution, in which the right to health must be guaranteed by the state. 
                        
                        Austria and Germany are among other countries planning a similar move.</p>
